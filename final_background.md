## Problem

The impact of changes in China's one-child policy on China's population and gender ratios.

## Background

Around the 1960s, China saw a huge leap in population due to low death rates and a spike in birth rates. With concern for the growth in population, policymakers instituted the one-child policy in 1980s. This policy restricted families to only birth one child and heavily fined those that raised more than one. Other enforcement methods included mandatory sterilization, forced abortions, and governmental pushes for contraceptives [1,3]. 

As of recent times, China sits at around 1.4 billion people as the number one most populous country [2]. The growth of the population seems to have died down thus far, and policymakers have relaxed the one-child policy in 2013 and proceeded to abolish it in 2016. Now China is allowing for each family to have two children [1]. Though the policy has ended, lasting effects can be seen in the population. Today, China is facing issues with an incredibly high male to female ratio [7]. The one-child policy may have expounded this issue. Due to the preference for male laborers in rural areas, and the limit on children, many rural families likely prefer for their one child to be male. There have been a number of cases of voluntary sex-selective abortions in rural areas, where fetuses are aborted after being determined female [6,7]. I would like to explore if there is a connection between changes in the policy and changes in gender ratios and number of sex-selective abortions across the years. 

Other changes in population have also been identified, such as an aging population and a greater number of old individuals [1,5]. I would also like to examine other aspects of China's population over time and find out if any other changes may be linked to alterations in the one-child policy.


## Questions and Justification

**Has China's population growth slowed in recent years and how might it be projected to grow?**

- China still faces many issues of overpopulation. Cities are crowded and the population is putting a strain on natural resources. Overpoplulation has contributed to growing water and air pollution as well [4]. Analyzing how the population is proceeding is important in determining whether the growth is sustainable.

**Were there any differences in the population / population growth before and after the repeal of the one-child policy?**
    
- As the one-child policy was such a long-lasting and widely enforced policy, I hypothesis that there would at least be some lasting effects. Exploring this question may give insight on how the policy has effected the population. 

**What does the gender ratio and mortality rate at birth by gender in china look like across the years and does the one-child policy seem to have an effect?**

- China currently has a higher male to female ratio and there has been evidence of sex-selective abortions in rural areas [6,7]. Examining how this has changed over time may reveal what factors effect the issue.

## Concerns and Considerations

If it is found that the population is no longer growing at a alarming rate, people may deem this as a success of the one-child policy. We should be careful to not ignore the negative consequences of such an impactful policy. Vice-versa, if female birth mortality is found to have increased under the policy, we should also be wary of jumping to overly demonizing the government and/or policy. Effects of policies are hard to predict, and reasons behind sex-selective abortions stretch beyond more than just one policy.

There are some concerns in attributing too much of the change in population to changes in the one-child policy. I would like to see if some of the changes line up with the timeline of changes to the policy, but this does not mean the policy is the sole or even main cause of population changes. We should keep in mind that other things, like economic and cultural changes, may have an effect on birth rates and gender ratios in China. Changes in policy may also be partly reactionary to changes in population too, so that is another thing to keep in mind.
