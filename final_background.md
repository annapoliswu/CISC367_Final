# Final Background

## Title

Analysis of China's Population.

## Problem

The impact of changes in China's one-child policy on China's population and gender ratios.

## Background

Around the 1960s, China saw a huge leap in population due to low death rates and a spike in birth rates. With concern for the growth in population, policymakers instituted the one-child policy in 1980s. This policy restricted families to only birth one child and heavily fined those that raised more than one. Other enforcement methods included mandatory sterilization, forced abortions, and governmental pushes for contraceptives [1,3]. 

Today, China still faces many issues of overpopulation. Cities are crowded and the population is putting a strain on natural resources. Overpoplulation has contributed to growing water and air pollution as well [4]. As of recent times, China sits at around 1.4 billion people as the number one most populous country [2]. 

## Questions and Justification

- Has China's population growth slowed in recent years and how might it be projected to grow? 
    - a
- Were there any differences in population / population growth before and after the repeal of the one-child policy?
    - a
- What does the gender ratio and mortality rate at birth by gender in china look like across the years and does the one-child policy seem to have an effect? 
    - a

## Concerns and Considerations

If it is found that the population is no longer growing at a alarming rate, people may deem this as a success of the one-child policy. We should be careful to not ignore the negative consequences of such an impactful policy. Vice-versa, if female birth mortality is found to have increased under the policy, we should also be wary of demonizing the government and policy too much. Effects of policies are hard to predict, and reasons behind sex-selective abortions stretch beyond more than just one policy.

There are some concerns in attributing too much of the change in population to changes in the one-child policy. I would like to see if some of the changes line up with the timeline of changes to the policy, but this does not mean the policy is the sole or even main cause of population changes. We should keep in mind that other things, like economic and cultural changes, may have an effect on birth rates and gender ratios in China. Changes in policy may also be partly reactionary to changes in population too, so that is another thing to keep in mind.
